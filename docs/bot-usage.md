# Bot Usage

The Discord Justice Bot offers a wide range of features to help you maintain a safe and fair environment in your server. Here's an overview of the main functionalities:

## Automatic Moderation

The bot can automatically detect and take action on various types of content:

- Spam and excessive messages
- Inappropriate language
- Phishing links
- Raid attempts

To configure automatic moderation, use the `!dj automod` command.

## User Management

Easily manage users with commands like:

- `!dj warn @user [reason]`: Issue a warning to a user
- `!dj mute @user [duration] [reason]`: Temporarily mute a user
- `!dj kick @user [reason]`: Kick a user from the server
- `!dj ban @user [reason]`: Ban a user from the server

## Logging and Monitoring

Keep track of all moderation actions and server events:

- Use `!dj logs` to view recent moderation actions
- Set up a dedicated logging channel with `!dj config logs #channel`

## Custom Rules

Create custom rules tailored to your server's needs:

1. Use `!dj rules add` to create a new rule
2. Define triggers and actions for the rule
3. Enable or disable rules as needed
