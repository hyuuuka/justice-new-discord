# Setting Up Effective Moderation for Large Discord Communities

Moderating a small Discord server with a few dozen active members is manageable with basic tools and a couple of dedicated moderators. However, when your community grows to thousands of members, moderation becomes exponentially more complex. This guide will help you establish robust moderation systems that scale with your community.

## The Challenges of Large-Scale Moderation

Large Discord communities face unique challenges:

- **Volume**: Thousands of messages per hour make manual monitoring impossible
- **Coordination**: Larger mod teams require clear communication and consistent enforcement
- **Complexity**: More members mean more edge cases and potential conflicts
- **Targeted Attacks**: Larger servers are more likely to be targeted by coordinated raids or spam attacks

## Building Your Moderation Team

### Team Structure

For large communities, we recommend a hierarchical structure:

1. **Head Moderators** (1-3 people): Set policies, handle escalations, and manage the mod team
2. **Senior Moderators** (3-7 people): Train new mods, handle complex cases, and oversee specific areas
3. **Moderators** (as needed): Handle day-to-day moderation tasks
4. **Trial Moderators**: New team members learning the ropes under supervision

### Moderator Selection

When selecting moderators, prioritize:

- **Reliability**: Consistent activity and follow-through

- **Alert System**: A way to quickly notify all online moderators during emergencies
- **Documentation**: Centralized, accessible documentation of all policies and procedures

## Moderation Workflows

### Tiered Response System

Implement a tiered system for rule violations:

1. **Warning**: For minor or first-time violations
2. **Timeout**: Temporary restriction for repeated minor violations
3. **Kick**: Removal with ability to rejoin for borderline cases
4. **Temporary Ban**: Time-limited bans for serious violations
5. **Permanent Ban**: Reserved for the most serious offenses or pattern of abuse

### Case Management

For transparency and consistency:

- **Case Numbers**: Assign unique identifiers to each moderation action
- **Documentation**: Record the details of each case, including evidence and reasoning
- **Review Process**: Regularly review recent cases to ensure consistency
- **Appeal System**: Provide a clear process for members to appeal moderation decisions

## Scaling Your Moderation

As your community continues to grow:

- **Channel Strategy**: Consider using more granular channel permissions and creating focused discussion spaces

This case study examines what happened and how our systems responded.

## The Attack Profile

The raid attempt showed several characteristics of a well-organized attack:

- **Distributed approach**: The attackers used over 200 accounts
- **Aged accounts**: Many accounts were several months old to bypass new-account filters
- **Preparation**: Attackers had joined slowly over several weeks to avoid detection
- **Coordination**: The attack was timed to occur when the server typically had minimal moderator presence

## Initial Detection

At 3:17 AM UTC, Discord Justice detected the first signs of unusual activity:

1. **Unusual message patterns**: Multiple accounts began posting similar messages across different channels
2. **Abnormal activity timing**: A sudden spike in activity during normally quiet hours
3. **Coordinated joining**: Several dormant accounts became active simultaneously

Within seconds of detecting the unusual pattern, Discord Justice initiated its automated defense protocols:

### Phase 1: Alert and Assessment

- **Moderator alerts**: Emergency notifications were sent to the moderation team
- **Lockdown preparation**: The system prepared for potential server lockdown
- **Pattern analysis**: Our AI began analyzing message patterns to identify all participating accounts

### Phase 2: Containment

As the attack escalated, the following measures were automatically implemented:

- **Message deletion**: Spam and raid messages were automatically removed
- **Account restriction**: Identified raider accounts were placed in timeout
- **Channel slowmode**: Affected channels had slowmode automatically enabled
- **Verification requirement**: The server's verification level was temporarily increased

### Phase 3: Mitigation

With the initial attack contained, the system:

- **Compiled evidence**: Gathered and organized evidence of the raid for later review
- **Identified additional accounts**: Used pattern matching to find dormant raider accounts
- **Implemented preventative bans**: Applied bans to accounts identified as part of the raid network

## Human Intervention

The automated systems bought crucial time for human moderators to respond:

1. **Situation assessment**: The first moderator arrived within 5 minutes and reviewed the system's actions
2. **Fine-tuning response**: Moderators adjusted some automatic actions based on context
3. **Community communication**: A brief announcement was made to inform members about the situation

## Attack Statistics

The scale of the prevented attack was significant:

- **217 accounts** identified as part of the raid
- **1,430 malicious messages** automatically removed
- **14 channels** targeted simultaneously
- **Under 30 seconds** from detection to initial containment
- **Zero** legitimate members incorrectly restricted

## Key Success Factors

Several factors contributed to the successful defense:

### Technical Factors

- **Pattern recognition**: Our advanced AI detected subtle coordination patterns
- **Rapid response**: Automated systems acted within seconds
- **Adaptive thresholds**: The system adjusted sensitivity based on time of day and server activity

### Preparation Factors

- **Proper configuration**: The server had previously configured appropriate bot permissions
- **Moderation protocols**: Clear emergency procedures were already established
- **Regular updates**: The bot was running the latest security definitions

## Lessons Learned

Even successful defenses provide opportunities for improvement:

1. **Enhanced sleeping account detection**: We've improved our ability to identify accounts that join but remain dormant
2. **Coordinated timing detection**: New algorithms now look for patterns in when accounts become active
3. **Cross-server intelligence**: We've enhanced our ability to track raid groups across multiple servers

## Implementing These Protections

To ensure your server has the same level of protection:
